######## Parameters for generating cuts

# BkgMode = 0 -- Generate cuts without subtracting background
# BkgMode = 1 -- Generate cuts including cuts for background determination based on data at 
# nearby Qs
# BkgMode = 2 -- Subtract polynomial background
BkgMode=1

# QMode=0 -- Generate cuts for a given reduced reciprocal wavevector
# QMode=1 -- Generate cuts for a list of wavevectors read from a file (textfile_for_selectedQs 
# must be specified)
# QMode=2 -- Generate multidimensional cuts (1D, 2D, and 3D) for a list of wavevectors read from
# a file (textfile_for_selectedQs must be specified)
# QMode=3 -- Generate rocking scans for a list of Q,E points read from a file 
# (textfile_for_selectedQs must be specified) This is only for data stored in HDF5 format.
QMode=1

# ------------------------ paralellism ----------------------------
# num_processes=2 -- number of processes to use for parallel constant-Q cuts. NOTE: 
# only GenerateConstQ.py is parallelized
num_processes=1

# horace_threads=2 -- Horace cuts/reduces the data using multithreaded parallelism. the 
# default is 8 threads (i think)
# if you use multiple processes to access data, it is easy to over-utilize the computer 
# if horace uses multiple threads. 
# generally you should keep [num_processes]x[horace_threads] <= the number of CORES on 
# your computer
horace_threads=8
